          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to within the experience was the
          website’s incredibly unconventional and unique design articulated by
          its loading page with flickering letters transitioning into the
          homepage with Rich Brown himself being front and center. It feels
          dynamic and unlike a typical website whilst displaying Brown’s vibrant
          personality and innovation. The blend of colour, typography and motion
          are enough to get the user to explore more of the website and as a
          freelance designer, that’s exactly what your website’s goal should be.

        <p>
          Although I just stated that the homepage was extremely captivating, I
          actually ended up spending more time looking through his various
          projects, all of which are detailed and structured brilliantly. Each
          project showcase not only puts his works on display but it manages to
          reveal his design processes and decisions during his time working on
          these projects whilst maintaining an interactive format. There’s so
          many images and videos that are easy to get lost in, showing Brown’s
          utmost dedication to his work and it’s something I really respect.

          4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h1>
        <p>
          My most frequent action was scrolling through the various pages of the
          website, allowing me to observe his homepage and projects in full
          detail. Seeing as Brown’s website is so interactive and
          exploration-focused, it only feels natural to keep on scrolling and
          discovering more and more about his works and personality. Both
          vertical and horizontal scrolling are implemented which only adds to
          the immersion of the experience.

          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The website’s primary goal is almost definitely to showcase Brown’s
          various projects to employers and clients, though I also think it’s
          designed to present his creative and bright personality to anyone
          interested, employers and clients included. Every design choice within
          the website feels deliberate whilst remaining functional and it
          showcases skills in both graphic design and technical design,
          perfectly setting up future career opportunities.

          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Brown’s website communicates this goal of showcasing his plethora of
          projects to employers and clients through making his website
          innovative and dynamic. As you dive deeper into his portfolio, you can
          really tell how much dedication Brown spent to make the website
          eye-catching whilst making sure to highlight his personality. It’s
          bold, it’s colourful and it’s unique which is something any client is
          looking for in a designer.

          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h1>
        <p>
          I think the website serves as an experience which can be repeated and
          looked back on by any user. On an initial run-through with how
          exploration-focused and large-scale the website is, it’s so easy to
          get lost in his mountain of interesting and different projects making
          it easy to miss details or even miss whole projects. Users can easily
          return to look through projects they might’ve missed on their initial
          experience which greatly increases engagement.

          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Brown’s website suggests repeat visits and experiences through
          unconventionality and captivation within its design meant to persuade
          the user to keep exploring. Additionally, as a designer rising within
          the design business, it’s only natural for his projects to increase
          over time which also encourages repeat visits in case his website has
          been updated to showcase anything new and unique.

          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The website’s main media forms is UX/UI design which Brown clearly
          specialises in, though it also refers to many additional media forms
          ranging from augmented reality, professional filmmaking and motion
          graphics, all of which he’s incorporated in his projects. These wildly
          different media forms really demonstrate Brown’s diverse skillset as a
          designer which perfectly sets him up for future career opportunities.

          10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h1>
        <p>
          To me, this website reveals that any user should be open to active
          engagement when interacting with an experience. These interactive
          elements and design decisions are made with user engagement in mind,
          and I think it’s important to respect that. It’s significantly more
          fun to interact with a website and soak in all the details rather than
          skimming through without a purpose.

        <p>
          When engaging with an experience, curiosity is the most important
          aspect in my opinion as the more curious a user is, the more likely
          they are to spend more time within the experience. You want users to
          see your design as something brilliant rather than something ordinary
          which makes interactive elements and unique styling so important as
          they encourage users to explore with a sense of wonder.

          12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h1>
        <p>
          This could possibly be a personal issue but when interacting with
          Brown’s website, my cursor was hidden the entire time which made it
          tougher to click on various interactive elements. For a less
          technically experienced user I can see this issue being quite a bother
          since they likely don’t have the necessary hand-eye coordination to
          picture where their cursor is to click on an element, which reduces
          navigation and exploration.

        <p>
          Far and away, the website’s most satisfying area is all of Brown’s
          project pages which are designed to be incredibly immersive and
          engaging. Every interactive element, whether it be a simple image or a
          more complex video, tells a different story and enhances the
          experience with Brown’s unique mold of typography, colour and motion
          graphics making scrolling through every page satisfying.
